            There are multiple turtle species that are being affected by the constant pollution from our daily waste, and improper disposal.
            Currently, all forms of life are being affected by the consumption of whole plastic waste as well as broken down micro-plastics
            across all bodies of water. If this isn't stopped as soon as possible we are faced with the harsh reality that we may never see
            turles like the one shown in the image above.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> Here are some of the common waste that we are throwing away in to the sea</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Plastic</li>
                <li>Toxic Waste</li>
                <li>Oil</li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <p>
            Here are some of the organizations that are fighting against pollution
        </p>
            <ol>
